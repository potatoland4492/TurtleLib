# TurtleLib

TurtleLib is a library of scripts that interact with the PythonTurtle module to create games, drawings, and more!

## Using the Scripts

Copy or download a script to your current working directory. Start python3 and run `import <script-name>`. The program should run automatically.

## Scripts

### Race

This script sets up a simple race layout for two players, one green and the other blue. When the game is set up, the script will prompt you to start the game. Press `Enter` on your keyboard to begin.
[race.py](./scripts/race.py)

### Cone

`cone` creates a nice cone shape.
[cone.py](./scripts/cone.py)
