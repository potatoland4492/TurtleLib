## Scripts

### Race

What this script does: It sets up a simple race layout for two players, one green and the other blue.
How to use: Copy the `race.py` script into your current working directory. Start Python and run `import race`. When the game is set up, the script will prompt you to start the game. Press `Enter` on your keyboard to begin.
